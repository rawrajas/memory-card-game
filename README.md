## 1) Introduction

This game was created using the starter code by Udacity (https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game).

A basic style framework and JS comments were provided, the rest was written by me, with the exception of the stopwatch function.

## 2) Instructions

Click on the cards one by one and find the matching symbols. A time and ranking will be provided once all cards are matched.

Ranking system is as follows:
Three stars- Less than 15 moves
Two stars- Less than 21 moves
One star- 21 or more moves
